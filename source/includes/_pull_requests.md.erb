### Pull Request state

The `state` attribute can have one of the following values.
The initial value set by the system is `pending`.
Once the pull request has been checked and deemed compatible to merge, the state is set to `open`.
If the pull request is not compatible, it is set to `incompatible`.

A pull request is compatible to merge only if the source topic contains all of the target topic's commits, with some unique commits added.

For example, a pull request merging [A -> B -> C] into [A -> B] is compatible, but a pull request merging [A -> B -> C] into [A -> D] is not.
Neither is [A -> B] into [A -> B].

Once a topic owner or one of the collaborators reviews the topic, the state is set to `working` by the system.
When the system has merged the topic (or not), the state is set to `accepted` (or `rejected` respectively).

State           | Description
--------------- | -----------
`pending`       | Queued for compatibility check [open]
`open`          | Compatible, ready to be reviewed [open]
`incompatible`  | Incompatible, cannot be reviewed [closed]
`working`       | Working, processing review [closed]
`accepted`      | Reviewed and accepted [closed]
`rejected`      | Reviewed and rejected [closed]
