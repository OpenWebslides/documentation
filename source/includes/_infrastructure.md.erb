# Infrastructure

A lot of tools are used in the development and deployment process.

- [Github](https://github.com/OpenWebslides/): Storage of code. Issues, projects and wiki are not used for persistent information: new issues are to be converted into backlog items at the end of every sprint. Pull requests (and reviews) are the only feature actively used in the development process.
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/OpenWebslides): Continuous integration. Tests the pushed code, and restricts pull requests only to code successfully tested and 100% covered.
- [Slack](https://openwebslides.slack.com): Team communication.
- [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/openwebslides/repository/docker/openwebslides/openwebslides): Automatically builds Docker images for every release.
- [Bugsnag](https://app.bugsnag.com/open-webslides/open-webslides/errors): Error tracking of frontend and backend exceptions.

The current Open Webslides server infrastructure consists of three environments (servers):

## owsdev

IP address: 157.193.230.127
Host: owsdev.ugent.be
URL: (http://owsdev.ugent.be/)[http://owsdev.ugent.be/]
Responsible contact: Florian Dejonckheere

This is the development server. Use this server when developing features and fixes. The version of the platform and stability thereof are not guaranteed. The database and repositories may be wiped at any time.

**UGent CAS**: The server should run a version **without** the UGent CAS-functionality, allowing local clients to manipulate the API.

**Access**: All developers should have access to this server using the `openwebslides@owsdev.ugent.be` user and their private key. If this is not the case, contact your system administrator and include your public key.

<aside class="warning">
  Do not store any important data on this server, as it may be wiped at any moment (usually not without notice)
</aside>

## owsqas

IP address: 157.193.231.202
Host: owsqas.ugent.be
URL: (https://owsqas.ugent.be/)[https://owsqas.ugent.be/]
Responsible contact: Florian Dejonckheere

This is the testing/QA server. Deploy to this server when testing releases before merging. The server should run a stable version.

**UGent CAS**: The server should run a version **with** the UGent CAS-functionality, in order to mirror the production environment.

**Access**: All developers should have access to this server using the `openwebslides@owsqas.ugent.be` user and their private key. If this is not the case, contact your system administrator and include your public key.

<aside class="warning">
  Do not store any important data on this server, as it will be wiped before testing new releases
</aside>

## owsprod

IP address: 157.193.231.203
Host: owsprod.ugent.be
URL: (https://owsprod.ugent.be/)[https://owsprod.ugent.be/]
URL: (https://openwebslid.es/)[https://openwebslid.es/]
URL: (https://openwebslides.ugent.be/)[https://openwebslides.ugent.be/]
Responsible contact: Florian Dejonckheere
Responsible for openwebslid.es: Ruben Verborgh

This is the production server. Only deploy stable, fully tested releases to this server, and only from the `master`-branch.

**UGent CAS**: The server runs a version **with** the UGent CAS-functionality.

**Access**: Only your system administrator has access to this server. Direct your queries to your system administrator if you want to deploy a release.

<aside class="notice">
  Do not use this server for development purposes. Queries to manipulate data manually will be ignored

## cocos

IP address: 157.193.215.95
Host: cocos.atlantis.ugent.be
URL: (https://cocos.education/)[https://cocos.education/]
URL: (https://my.cocos.education/)[https://my.cocos.education/]
URL: (https://publications.cocos.education/)[https://publications.cocos.education/]
URL: (https://cocos.digital/)[https://cocos.digital/]
Responsible contact: Florian Dejonckheere

This is the server for the CoCOS project. It hosts two WordPress installation on (https://cocos.education/)[https://cocos.education/] and (https://publications.cocos.education/)[https://publications.cocos.education/], and one Moodle installation on (https://my.cocos.education/)[https://my.cocos.education/].


## Deploying on owsdev/owsqas

```shell
# SSH into the server
$ ssh openwebslides@owsdev.ugent.be -i /path/to/keyfile

# You're now in /opt/openwebslides. The app is located in /opt/openwebslides/OpenWebslides
$ cd OpenWebslides

# This folder contains the cloned git repository
# You can now navigate to any branch/commit you want to
$ git branch
* (detached from 038655f)
  master
  no-cas

$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout b5c3912

# The platform configuration should already be present and correct
# If this is not the case, refer to the Administrator's setup guide

# Build the application image
$ docker build -t openwebslides/openwebslides:latest .

# Bring down the running application and restart it in the background with the new image
$ docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d
```

## Deploying on owsprod

```shell
# SSH into the server
$ ssh openwebslides@owsprod.ugent.be -i /path/to/keyfile

# You're now in /opt/openwebslides. The app is located in /opt/openwebslides/OpenWebslides
$ cd OpenWebslides

# This is again just the cloned git repository
# However it should always be on the `master` branch and only `git pull` should be used
$ git pull

# Build the application image
$ docker build -t openwebslides/openwebslides:latest .

# Before the next step, make sure nobody is using the platform
# Preferably only restart the application during off-peak times

# Bring down the running application and restart it with the new image
# ATTENTION: to enable TLS communication, an alternative docker-compose should be specified
$ docker-compose down; docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Tips

```shell
## Opening a Rails console
$ docker-compose exec app bundle exec rails console

## Opening a shell to the `data/` directory
$ docker-compose exec app bash
# cd data/
# ls
```
